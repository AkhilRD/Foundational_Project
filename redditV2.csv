29,Why I don't sell my $TSLA,2022-06-19 08:07:19,"**A list of reasons why I can't seem to sell my $TSLA**

1. I love my Tesla Model 3 (even without autopilot on)  - Best car ever!
2. EV is the future -- I pay next to nothing in comparison to my former gas car; no maintenance either
3. Even if $TSLA goes to 450 (which it will or even harder to believe 250....) -- It'll pop right back up to 550 then 650....etc. can't keep progress down
4. I can't get behind anything else right now....
5. Tesla is the next Apple -- it just is...
6. Elon tweets too much -- but oh well -- he's earned his voice and should be free to speak his mind
7. Every time I even try to sell my $TSLA -- I buy it right back again... and usually buy even more....
8. During the dot com crash I held out and held out then finally under duress sold all my $AAPL -- missed the pop and have regretted it ever since... I regretted not selling at the top too... but that ship has sailed...
9. I didn't sell in November, January, March, May --- I really could have -- but just couldn't...
10. Looking forward to the next stock split... and then the next and the next....

I would like to short TSLA at say 705 but at the same time sell a CSP for say 650 and use the premium obtained as buffer for a stop loss in case the stock shoots up higher.
So a CSP for $650 expiring 40 days out provides a premium of $40. Place a stop loss order at say $740 to cover in case the position moves against you.
If at expiry the stock is above 650 but below 705, either cover at that price or another put option can be sold and the premium again used for the stop loss cover. The difference between 705 and the cover price is additional earning that you get to keep.

Highly recommend to avoid earnings.

50,$1300 target just now,2022-06-01 14:42:19," Why This Tesla Analyst Thinks Worst May Be Behind For The EV Pioneer  
by  
Shanthi Rexaline, Benzinga Staff Writer  
June 1, 2022 10:09 AM | 1 min read  


A Mizuho Securities analyst sees Tesla bouncing back as supply chain challenges improve.  
The new Gigas in Texas and Berlin may help counterbalance the production-constrained Shanghai plant.  


What Happened: Tesla stock could rocket higher in 2022 as the bear-case scenario fades, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a note on Tuesday, according to Tesmanian.  


Rakesh was commenting after Tesla hosted him at the Fremont, California factory.  


The analyst said Tesla faces near-term headwinds as Giga Shanghai, which makes up about 40-50% of its total capacity, has yet to produce at pre-lockdown rates. This, however, sets Tesla up for a strong second-half rebound, he added.  


April deliveries may have been at 40,000 units, down 22% from January's 51,000 units, Rakesh noted. This, according to the analyst, could lead to a sequential revenue decline in the June quarter.  


""That said, we believe a potentially stronger SepQ/DecQ rebound is possible with improved supply chains and Berlin ramping,"" Rakesh said.  


Why It's Important: Tesla's Giga Shanghai has begun running two shifts since last week, and it is rumored that production at the plant may have returned to 70% of pre-COVID levels.  


The opening of two new Gigas in Texas and Berlin may take some pressure off the production-constrained Shanghai plant. Giga Shanghai, however, is important, not only from the perspective of output, but also for margins.  


Rakesh reaffirmed his Buy rating and $1,300 price target for Tesla stock.",Bullish

""26% of the company‚Äôs GAAP earnings in 2021 were from the sale of regulatory credits, not from the underlying economics of making and selling vehicles and other ancillary services. Once incumbents increase production of EVs they will need to purchase fewer credits from Elon. That means Tesla needs to actually start *selling* *cars* to make money. The catch-22 is that for the company to sell more cars, it first needs to increase its production capacity.""

""Tesla‚Äôs first-mover advantage has long been cited as reason enough for investors to pile their money into the company. However, that advantage is gone, and in some cases turning into a lag. Ford (F), Rivian (RIVN), and General Motors (GM) aim to produce EV trucks in 2022, but Tesla will be on the sidelines until at least 2023 before launching its Cybertruck.""

With [light truck sales](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/light-trucks-now-outselling-cars/) comprising more than three out of every four vehicles sold in the U.S. in January 2022, Tesla falling behind in truck EVs means its share of the U.S. market could fall further. ""

""Despite the increased competition, failure to meet delivery expectations, and diminutive share of the global EV market in 2021, Tesla‚Äôs valuation implies the company will own 57% of the global passenger EV market in 2030.

Even if Tesla increases the average selling price (ASP) per vehicle to $55K vs. ($49K in 2021), Tesla‚Äôs stock price at \~$1,100/share implies the firm will sell 15 million vehicles in 2030 versus \~936k in 2021. That figure represents 57% of the [projected base case global EV passenger vehicle market](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2021/prospects-for-electric-vehicle-deployment) in 2030 and the implied vehicle sales based on a lower ASP looks even more unrealistic.""

107,TSLA Call strategy.,2022-04-26 17:24:15,"I was pretty sure TSLA would drop this morning and liquidated at open at around $992 and rebought at $900. Now I'm trying to pick a call. I just went in pretty light on -TSLA20220513C900 as a ""just in case it shoots back up after lunch"". 

I feel deep down in my cockles this dip will not last a week; people will realize Twitter funding is not going to be from a selloff and Elon won't abandon Tesla to focus on it. However, I'm actually pretty risk averse, so I'm maybe going to go heavy on July 15. The problem is that those option prices are too high to make it feel worth it at all. I think I'm going to be happy with my 10% stock quantity gain and the potential for a nice light call return and see if this dip has legs and those later option prices start falling.

EDIT: Well I maxed out my margin getting those bargain barrel prices this Thursday morning. I hope this is the bottom. I went with a mix of low-cost/higher-risk calls and distant-close/costly calls. Also grabbed some more stock.

If I had to guess what this dip is about, I don't think it's investor fear of the Twitter deal, I think very big players are trying to wipe out TSLA value to endanger Musk's loan collateral for the Twitter deal. I think they're spending a lot of money to do this in hopes the deal will fall through so they can make money on short positions on Twitter. If this is really happening, I am too dumb to understand how they can afford the cost of driving TSLA down; maybe they loaded up on puts before hand? They have to really be banking on the people with out-of-the-money calls that expire tomorrow to feed further retraction and for the deal to fall through before TSLA rebounds.

I may have just talked myself into taking some gains today or tomorrow morning and looking for a further dip tomorrow afternoon.",Bullish

[https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=tsla](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=tsla)

Above are two links for Failed to deliver charts that show how much failed to delivers are out there. the second link is specific to TSLA. It shows that hedge funds did not close their positions instead just failed to deliver instead of covering their positions. The SEC makes the chart a little confusing so you'll have to spend a few minutes to understand what you are seeing and how to use it but basically the bottom green circles are the volume of shorts that have failed to deliver and the blue dots show the strike price of the failed option. For instance if you look at Sept 1st 2020, 1,240,984 calls failed to deliver at the strike price of $475. For those who don't understand calls when you buy a short position you are purchasing 100 shares per put and that means they failed to deliver 100,240,984 shares that they borrowed with a promise to buy back at a future set date. They did not close their positions and just payed a fee to extend them to a further date. Which we as retail traders can't do. They could not cover because the price spiked so high that they would owe over fifty billion dollars just for that batch of shorts depending on when they would have tried to close their position. Throughout the chart their are well over 40 million failed to deliver shorts and i just scanned it and counted that much. So i hope this kind of helps people to understand the importance of direct registering your shares and how they use your shares to continue this charade of making millions of fake shares from the shares you paid for. Your shares are registered under your broker who than lends them to hedge funds and day traders to short your stock. They pay alot less than we do for options and when they do not fulfill their obligations they just pay a fee and push out the date and never cover. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at the first link that is all the failed to delivers in the whole market. It is a sight to be seen. A list so long with so many failed to deliver options that it seems unbelievable. It is hard to believe that the stock market is so corrupt and at the same time all the information of their corruption is right there for everyone to see. Spend some time looking into FTD and how hedge funds have closed millions of successful businesses by robbing them of their ability to grow using fake articles and MSM. Just like they did to Papa Elon back in 2018 before he did the split. He expressed his frustration  and how he almost went bankrupt. Luckily he figured out how to make make the situation benefit him. But he wasn't able to stop the continuous assault and you are seeing it live as good news comes out and our beloved stock drops. Direct Register your shares it is the only way to slow down their progress and eventually force them to cover if enough people do their part. I for one don't like the idea of being used especially when I have invested heavily into this stock and the future of my children are riding on this.",Other

Since TSLA is heavily shorted it would be in everyone's best interest to direct register their share because if they don't brokers will lend out the share to short sellers who in return can turn one share into thousands of synthetic or naked shares to short your investment. It seems like the only logical thing would be to direct register your shares so the shares are registered in your name the buyer vs the broker which all brokers loan out the shares to short sellers.

This usually takes a couple weeks, but this has been such a high profile black eye for German industry that reports are indicating it could be approved Friday.

179,I'm shamelessly scalping TSLA calls and wondering when this gravy train will end.,2022-02-17 16:05:09,"I got my first taste Jan 30th when I went heavy on calls on that crazy dip to $800 to Feb 1st when it hit $945 and I sold those calls for a very large profit (these were $900 strike, April calls I was prepared to hold to for months because I'm a TSLA bull). I then did it again, and again, and again and I'm about to buy again today.

This isn't normal right? Has TSLA always been a money making tick-tock like this? Theta Gang, is it normal for the price of options to swing so much with the stock price volatility? Who is so dumb they are selling call options so cheap in the trough of a dip that will only last 36 hours? Who is buying calls at such high premiums at what is at best a plateau if not the peak before a ""correction""? Even a hardcore bear can't possibly believe that every dip is the start of TSLA going bankrupt (I could see any number of Bulls seeing $925 as a bargain with eyes to $1800 by year end, so that part is less crazy to me). With my sale yesterday I've seen a more than 100% return and I'm a complete novice just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I see it as a minimal risk thing since if the call option value doesn't go up, I can just hold it because I really am a Bull and only buy options I think will make it past break even before expiring. My biggest risk is selling expecting another dip and that dip never coming, but I've already made as much as I expected to make holding the calls long.

Theta Gang, tell me how I will go bankrupt before I do it.

EDIT: Well, I went in light on calls at $75 yesterday (2/17) and it's down to $55 right now debating where the floor is going to be to double up and bring my cost basis down. There are press attacks coming from a lot of angles right now (SEC scuffle, Consumer Reports FUD, Elon tweeting about Hitler, fear that 5billion stock gift will be liquidated), so I think it will actually go lower today. Thinking about maybe doing a shorter term option this time since the rebound from Y delivers out of Austin will happen very soon.

EDIT2: I was still holding those $75s, but also got $20s on Thursday (24th) morning (moved basis to $47.5) that made up for them just now at $63 (28th, morning). I still think there is no problem going long to April, but I'll be able grab another dip before then.

EDIT3: I grabbed the Mar 14th dip big (25) at $16 and just sold them today Mar 22nd at $116. I can't feel my face.",Other

229,Retired and have more than half of my money in TSLA. Now what?,2022-01-18 17:53:03,"
I bought 50 shares of Tesla in July of 2020, just before they split and ended up with 250 shares. I bought a few more shares over the next year or two and now I have about 500 shares.

I live in Canada, so I need to convert the value of those shares into Canadian dollars, and now I have a total portfolio value of about 1.25 million dollars, with more than half of it in Tesla...

Not complaining! Loving life...

I really believe in this company and think the shares are going to be at $2k-$3k in the next couple of years, so I don't want to sell, but I am paranoid that something is going to happen that causes Tesla stock to lose half its value. I will then freak out, because I lost half of my retirement...

I've got a BSc. in economics and worked in director and VP level positions in Silicon Valley for 30 years, so I'm not a moron, but I'm in this weird FOMO situation where I have made a ton of money on TESLA and don't want to lose out on making a ton more. Am I an idiot? Wait, don't answer that... Okay, answer it...

Before you answer, please think about the very real possibility that Tesla shares could be worth more than $2,000 by the end of this year. Yes, they could also be worth $500 by the end of this year, but given their recent Q4 2021 delivery numbers, Giga Austin and Giga Berlin coming online in the next few weeks and the fact that most of the other car companies are wallowing in their own feces, I'm thinking Tesla's prospects are pretty bright.

To summarize my entire picture, I have about $1.25 million CAD in my portfolio. Tesla shares make up over $600,000 of this. About $400,000 is in a passive income portfolio that generates about $3,000 a month for me and the rest is in cash, gold, silver, Bitcoin, ether...

I would love some suggestions, but I will be very hard pressed to sell any of my Tesla shares.

Please note multiple of 100 for Tesla makes sense due to unbelievable growth, noting it has 28% delivery growth, which likely translates to 56% EBITDA growth QoQ as Q2 delivery growth was 20% and EBITDA growth was 41%. Using 33% as conservative EBITDA growth and 56% as aggressive.

Q221 - 2b Annualized 8b = $800 PT 
Q321 - 2.8b Annualized 11.2b=$1120 PT
Conservative
Q421 - 3.75b Annualized 15b=$1500 PT
Aggressive
Q421 - 4.37b Annualized 17.47=$1747 PT

Expecting this to rally to between 1500-1747 before next earnings.

If growth continues at current pace, my estimate is we will be looking at close to $2500 price target by end of 2022. 

So stay excited, as this is modeling the way market is behaving. And that is what really matters. 

Remember Amazon has only 10% growth and has multiple of 64.5, so Tesla with annualized 120% should definitely have 100 or higher multiple.",Bullish

An exchange-traded fund with holdings picked by artificial intelligence is betting on big gains from Tesla and Nvidia in January. It has been right about a number of price swings for electric-vehicle leader Tesla stock before.

AI-powered investor Qraft, a South Korean fintech with almost $60 million in assets across four ETFs, doubled down on Tesla (ticker: TSLA), which also was its largest holding in December, while pouring into shares of chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) this month.",Bullish

241,Tesla vs competition,2022-01-06 12:43:53,"Porsche America sold 70,025 vehicles last year, 9,419 were electric

Ford sold 27,140 Mach-Es in 2021. Ford recently said it would triple production of Mustang Mach-Es to 200,000 units by 2023. The automaker is also planning to nearly double the production capacity of the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup to 150,000 vehicles per year by mid-2023. So by mid 2023 they will be at an annual run rate of about 350,000 electric vehicles.

GM‚Äôs EV unit sales projected to reach 114k in 2022

VW sold about 400k electric cars in 2021, Mercedes about 220k and Volvo about 180k

**Tesla sold 308k cars in Q4 alone and just shy of 1M cars in 2021**

**Tesla is projected to sell close to 2M cars in 2022**

By 2023 Tesla should approach 4M cars sold, compare this to the ones mentioned above and tesla is lightyears ahead. They are also lightyears ahead in automotive software and AI, never mind new batteries around the corner! The main differentiator are their factories, built from the ground up for all electric auto manufacturing where others are using old factories and ICE staff. In Shanghai alone a tesla is produced every 38 seconds, no other company come close, they all take 10x+ to make one car. 

The writing is on the wall with Austin and Berlin starting up now, 4680 batteries production ramping up, FSD getting perfected, Insurance program expanding, Solar and Powerwall/grid expanding, Tesla phone rumored in 2022 (if that happens it is a huge game changer as Apple iPhone is stalling in innovation, Tesla phone would work everywhere and use Starlink giving Tesla not only phone sales but recurring revenue from subscriptions!) 

Watch tesla Y become the worlds most selling car by 2024 followed by Cybertruck.

Financials coming later this month will blow out estimates just like production/sales numbers did Q4.

Electric car adoption will explode imho, following Norway's lead where 65% of all cars sold in 2021 were electric with Tesla in a solid lead.

The writing is on the wall, we know what's coming. My estimate for stock price 2022 is $2-3K, if the phone happens then we can increase that estimate by 50%.",Bullish

247,"The road to 20M in 2030, from a historical and short-term predictive perspective",2022-01-04 07:58:48,"Tesla has had a goal of producing 20 million cars by 2030.

That's not interesting news.

What is interesting is how ""easy"" that road has become.

In 2012 they produced their first 2650 cars.

In order to build 20M cars by 2030 from that basis, they would have needed to increase production by 64% per year.

Since then, they have increased production by 91% per year.

Now, that is including the 2012 to 2013 increase, which is a bit dishonest because production didn't start at the beginning of 2012, so we should drop 2012, and just start at 2013.

If you start in 2013, the year-over-year increase is 59%. And that was hamstrung by financial limitations, then COVID, then supply chain limitations, and then German bureaucracy.

In order to make 20M by 2030, Tesla now ""only"" needs to increase production by 41% until 2030.

To stay on path, Tesla needs to do the following production:

2022 -	1 315 469

2023 -	1 848 521

2024 -	2 597 575

2025 -	3 650 158

2026 -	5 129 268

2027 -	7 207 739

2028 -	10 128 443

2029 -	14 232 669

2030 -	20 000 000

So, let's talk about 2022, which is obviously a pivotal year.

And let's do some lazy-ass math.

First off, Q4 was 308,000.

Let's assume zero growth of Shanghai and Fremont.

So, 1,232,000 just from Fremont and Shanghai in 2022. (Low, of course.)

As it happens, Berlin and Austin are both coming online at about the same time as Shanghai did.

Shanghai started at 1,000 cars per week, with a single shift. Berlin and Austin will be starting with 3 shifts. By the end of the year, it was up to 8,000 cars per week.

I'm not willing to give any non-China that type of ramp, even though I believe they could. So, let's say it averages 3000 cars per week per site (again, surreally low, IMO). That's 312,000 cars from those two sites.

That's 1,544,000 cars in 2022.

That lowers the production growth rate to 38%.

This is for a company that will have had an increase of 89% (from 2020 to 2021) and 65% (from 2021 to 2022 (hypothetically)).

(And, to be frank, I think the correct number is 1.9M in 2022, which means Tesla only has to increase production 34% each year to 2030 to make it to 20M cars. I think you'll get 900k out of Shanghai, 600k out of Fremont (I have doubts about Fremont's ability to increase production much more than this), 300k out of Texas, and 200k out of Berlin.)

High-interest rates can cause a chain reaction that affects the economy drastically. This can lead to a recession and the only way for interest rates to go back down is from the government and this can take much time. Toyota is down 4.8% in the past 5 days and Tesla is down 7.5% in the past 5 days. Tesla‚Äôs stock can also be down because of how many Bitcoins they own and the drop in price of that as well.

266,Key Trendline Could Send EV Giant Tesla Back Up the Charts,2021-12-15 20:14:54," Key Trendline Could Send EV Giant Tesla Back Up the Charts  
By: *Schaeffer's Investment Research* ***|*** *December 15, 2021*  


‚Ä¢ Tesla stock is trading near a trendline that's acted as a springboard in the past  


‚Ä¢ Tesla could benefit from a shift in the options pits  


Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) notched a record high of $1,243.49 around the time the company joined the trillion-dollar club, but has pulled back in recent weeks. In fact, since that peak, the equity has taken a nearly 25% haircut. Despite its shaky performance on the charts of late, investors shouldn't swear off the stock just yet, as it has dipped to a key trendline with historically bullish implications.  


Specifically, TSLA has come within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average after of trading above the trendline since July. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, at least four similar signals have occurred in the past three years. The equity enjoyed a positive return one month later in half of those instances, averaging a 12% gain. From the stock's current perch of $935, a similar move would put Tesla stock back over the $1,000 mark. Even better, the stock's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 32 sits just on the cusp of ""oversold"" territory. This indicator typically predates a short-term bounce.  


üì∑  


Put buying is still all the rage, leaving ample room for a shift in sentiment amongst options traders, that could boost the shares higher. Data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) shows the security with a 10-day put/call volume ratio of 1.20, which ranks higher than all other readings in its annual range, meaning puts are being bought at their fastest rate in 12 months.  


Tesla stock has tended to exceed options traders volatility expectations during the past year. This is per TSLA's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS), which ranks at a high 80 out of 100.",Bullish

Dont downvote me just because i'm semi-bearish, please poke some holes in this or change my mind or help me understand where i'm wrong. I'm really young and only been in stocks for about 3 years so there's so much i don't know

I'm only in this stock to make money so damn I hope you guys are right. I watch all the big tesla podcasts, (rob mauer, dave, sandy etc and follow gary black's play-by-plays on twitter). I first bought during the march 2020 crash pretty much right at the bottom and kept selling and buying back and have missed out on a lot of return because of this.

I'm really easily swayed by shit I read online and videos of FSD disengagements where the car will turn into bike and tram lanes, which are often at points where I really don't think you can code to fix and where vision-only can help or some sort of GPS with lane information which the FSD brain can read from

I've read stuff about how the human eye is just so much better at judging distances than cameras and how an oncoming car at a bend is not distinguishable from a car oncoming in the same lane as you, especially without a human brain behind it

Source: [https://twitter.com/mostlyharmlessz/status/1469421762555351042?s=20](https://twitter.com/mostlyharmlessz/status/1469421762555351042?s=20)

But then I see all the clips of how the FSD swerves out of danger which would have killed the driver. I'm just so confused

Does anyone have any information for me which would help me just not paper hand? Stuff like Elon selling stock just spooks me out and all I can think about is what if he's actually selling out at the top like most other CEO's do even though I know he's paying taxes and prob just taking some out incase the market tanks and to fund stuff like SpaceX, neuralink, boring tunnel and other shit we don't know about yet. At the end of the day most CEO's are narcissistic manipulative sociopaths.

It's hard to believe a Tesla analyst at every huge fund hasn't presented a bull thesis similar to what we see in here, podcasts and teslainvestorsclub, but it would look terrible and damage their reputation if they sold these pitches to clients who ended up losing a shit-load of money. Luckily as retail investors we work for ourselves and we don't have to worry about having people pissed off at us

WS estimates all conservative because they are supposed to be, and they have PTSD from losses from the 00's where exponential growth was promised but never delivered and what kind of losses people took during those bubbles. They need to preserve their reputation because Tesla is only 1 stock and there are hundreds of other companies doing great stuff, and they want their clients to keep using them in the future when Tesla is a mature company. I haven't had a McDonalds milkshake since I got food poisoning from one in Italy 10 years ago

Sometimes I do fear that legacy auto will just copy the Tesla blueprint and manufacture their new EV product portfolios with lower gross margins, especially since Tesla aren't protective of their patents. Honestly, I just love the look of BMW / Mercedes Sedans with their small accents and ridges which Tesla won't do because it costs more, and as a consumer I don't give a shit if Mercedes is making 5% vs Tesla making 40% on a car, I just care about the price I'm paying. I don't think I'm alone in this, seriously just look at a Mercedes C300 Coupe, if that was electric I'd buy it over a Tesla and most of my friends agree with me on that. I know most bull models are built on a 20% market share but will 1 in 5 people really buy a Tesla over all other cars?

We're finally in the age where it's possible to grow exponentially because of globalisation, transport improvements and the internet, but exponential loss is also possible now as tech start-ups can simplify an old process at a much lower cost and cannibalise old industries. I'm talking more about SaaS here and not Tesla who are just so clearly ahead in manufacturing capabilities (FOR NOW) but that being said:

Because of all of this I struggle to hold Tesla through dips and often trim my holdings or sell completely and buy back later either a little lower or higher because I know that a couple of numbers like a demand slowdown could completely change analyst expectations on the company.

Even if shareholder sentiment doesn't change, institutions can fuck the stock at any moment. I also feel that the earnings multiple is just so high and has so much riding on it even though I've read, understand and believe all the bull theses that I read. Tesla feels like a speculative asset because of that, it's a very strong bubble with great foundations and hopefully it develops into a metal sphere

I would love for someone to poke holes in my thinking or just tell me where i'm wrong",Other

## Company Insiders Are Back in Buying Mode -- Even Tesla's Elon Musk -- Barrons.com

6:45 am ET December 10, 2021 (Dow Jones) Print

It's going to be another absorbing day for [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) investors and others watching the stock.

The electric-car maker's stock fell 6% Thursday but held above $1,000, perhaps suggesting investors are intent on defending that level. It was a strange day really -- social media had expected big news but instead there was no news, apart from CEO Elon Musk selling more stock. He sold another 934,091 shares for $963.2 million, taking the total share sale on his selling streak above 11 million, while also exercising options to purchase 2.2 million shares at $6.24.

The shares were lower again in premarket trading Friday and an open below $1,000 could be a significant milestone.

While there have been other market factors, [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock has fallen 18% since Musk asked Twitter if he should sell 10% of his stake on Nov. 6 -- and he still has to sell another six million shares or so to reach that target.

When the billionaire, who has repeatedly said [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) is overvalued, first starting his selling spree, insider selling was all the rage, according to InsiderTracking's INK U.S. insider sentiment indicator. As investors were pushing the S&amp;P 500 to regular new highs, company insiders were stepping up selling.

That has all changed over the past month as insider optimism has risen around 15%, the daily survey, which monitors insider buying and selling, revealed.

But it isn't as if Musk is bucking the trend. He has exercised options to buy more than 12 million shares in the past month, actually slightly increasing his overall stake.",Bullish

Back in 2019, he had a price target north of $500 for [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock when it was below $300. That was before [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s five-for-one stock split. It was also back when [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) was worth roughly $60 billion.

Ferragu has stayed bullish, for the most part, but other analysts have taken turns claiming the top price-target slot. Coming into Wednesday, the top [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) price target came from China Securities analyst Zhu Yue at $1,485. The analyst rates [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock at Buy.

That target values [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) at roughly $1.5 trillion. [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) has about 1 billion shares outstanding, excluding management stock options that are likely to become shares someday.

Ferragu took his price target past Zhu's Wednesday, setting it at $1,580, up from a recent price target of $1,298. That's the new highest mark on Wall Street and values the company at about $1.6 trillion.

The bump isn't giving [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock the boost bulls would love, though. Shares are down about 0.6% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.

Still, ""multiple strong catalysts"" in 2022 can drive shares higher in coming months, wrote Ferragu in his Wednesday report. Those include: an upside fourth quarter, strong production from [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s Shanghai facility, new production capacity coming online in Germany and Texas, and new batteries for [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) EVs.

For the fourth quarter, Ferragu expects [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) to deliver about 283,000 vehicles. Wall Street projects about 266,000. What's more, Ferragu expects about 1.5 million vehicles sold for [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) in 2022. Current Wall Street estimates for 2022 deliveries range from about 1.3 million to 1.4 million units.

The higher volumes will come from [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s two new manufacturing facilities.

""Despite the ramp of two factories, we expect margins to expand,"" added the analyst. Ferragu expects gross profits to break 30% by the end of 2022, up from the mid-20% currently.

Batteries will benefit the company this coming year too. ""We expect 4680 production to be in full swing by year-end and grow rapidly from there."" The ""4680"" refers to the cylinder-shaped batteries [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) is planning to use. When batteries get bigger, costs go down and performance improves. The ""46"" in ""4680"" refers to the diameter in millimeters, while the ""80"" refers to the length in millimeters. The current generation of EV batteries used by [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) and others are called ""2170."" That's 21 millimeters in diameter and 70 millimeters in length.

AA batteries for consumer electronics are about 14 millimeters in diameter and 50 millimeters in length.

The Wall Street Buy-rating ratio for [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock didn't change with Ferragu's new target as he was already at Buy. Overall, 48% of about 50 analysts covering [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock rate it at Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&amp;P 500 is about 55%.

The average analyst price target edged up about $50 over the past month to about $830.

279,Tesla ride sharing,2021-12-07 11:37:49,"**Cathie Wood**\-led **Ark Invest** said on Monday that **Tesla** **Inc‚Äôs** (NASDAQ: TSLA) latest move to allow car sharing on its mobile app brings its user one step closer towards monetizing their electric car and transforming¬†it from a ""stranded asset"" into a ""revenue generating machine.""

**What Happened:** Ark analyst Tasha Keeney said speculation has been rife that Tesla is planning a ride-hailing network after its recent software update that allows owners to share the vehicle with others via the phone app.¬†

A Twitter account that monitors the app store for any new updates on the Tesla app, had last week revealed that the new version of the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs mobile app has a feature that allows owners to share cars.

&gt;Version 4.3.1 has been released here's what we've found:  
\-Sharing your Tesla vehicle with others  
\-Asset for vehicle sharing  
\-Endpoints related to vehicle sharing  
That's about it in this update, if we find anything else we will add to this thread! Have a great night! pic.twitter.com/xkR7Qluk5z  
‚Äî Tesla App Updates (iOS) (@Tesla\_App\_iOS) December 3, 2021

The update appears to enable Tesla owners to allow multiple drivers access to their cars through the mobile app, which was previously only possible through the website.

Ark has previously noted how Tesla could launch a competitive and profitable human-driven ride-hail service before rolling out an autonomous taxi network.

‚ÄúSuch a strategy could add a tremendous amount of training data to its autonomous neural network and lay the groundwork for the routing and payment infrastructure necessary for an autonomous ride-hail service,‚Äù Keeney wrote in a note.

The latest update would allow family members, car renters, and professional ride-hail drivers to share virtual keys to their Tesla vehicles, as per the analyst, which could ultimately allow a Tesla vehicle to be¬†transformed from a ""stranded asset"" into a ""revenue generating machine.""

**Why It Matters:** Wood‚Äôs money managing firm, which counts Tesla as its largest holding, has previously said it believes the Musk-led company could pose a serious threat to ride-sharing companies such as **Uber Technologies** Inc (NYSE: UBER) and **Lyft Inc** (NASDAQ: LYFT), once autonomous taxis commercialize.

Musk has previously talked about launching a ride-hailing service with drivers before rolling out an autonomous driving network.

The Tesla CEO¬†has been promising fully self-driven electric cars for years. The company had last week launched another update for the **Full Self-Driving** (FSD) **Beta** program with focus on vision, object detection, and the precision of movements by the vehicle.

The FSD Beta updates are released every two weeks and are led by an army of Tesla owners, or beta testers, who have exclusive access to the automaker‚Äôs newest and most robust releases of its semi-autonomous driving program.¬†

Elon Musk may have sold over 10 million shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla ([**NASDAQ: TSLA**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&amp;guccounter=1)) over the past month, but the CEO has actually increased his overall holdings in the company since the start of his massive selloff.

287,"Tesla Just Launched a New EV.

This vehicle, however, isn't likely to move the stock. It might motivate [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)\-loving parents to rush to the company's website, however, to procure the coolest gift for the holidays.

[Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) (ticker: TSLA) is now selling the Cyberquad -- a four-wheeled ATV modeled after its avant-garde Cybertruck. It retails for $1,900 and is designed for kids.

""Get ready for any adventure,"" begins the product description. For kids, that feels apt. The ATV has a steel frame, cushioned seats, adjustable suspension, disc brakes, and LED lights. The lithium-ion battery will provide 15 miles of range and the motor will push Cyberquad to a top speed of 10 miles an hour.

Barron's imagines that sounds pretty cool to 10-year olds. [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s recommended minimum age is eight years old.

Customers can order Cyberquad now. It begins shipping in two to four weeks, according to [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s website, but orders aren't guaranteed to arrive before the holidays.

While it may generate buzz, the Cyberquad launch probably isn't a stock-moving event. [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) stock was up about 1% in premarket trading Thursday, but S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained as well, rising about 0.6% and 0.9%, respectively.

What investors really want is the Cybertruck, [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s entry into the pickup-truck market. Deliveries are expected in early 2022, but an exact date isn't known. [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) didn't respond to a request for comment about the timing.

An update about Cybertruck deliveries might come on the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call, slated for late January. CEO Elon Musk said he would be on that call and provide investors with an updated product road map. [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378)'s coming models include the Cybertruck, a new roadster, and a semi-truck. Down the road, [Tesla](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378) wants to be selling a lower-priced EV that starts at about $25,000.

289,"Tesla‚Äôs stock is still cheap, says manager of new ETF who made Musk‚Äôs EV company its No. 1 holding",2021-12-01 19:22:21," Gary Black of the Future Fund Active ETF expects Tesla to maintain its market share, which could mean a surge in profits and share price  


Tesla‚Äôs network of 30,000 superchargers is one of its many advantages over competitors, according to Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund Active ETF.  
Gary Black and business partner David Kalis established the technology-oriented Future Fund Active ETF FFND, -0.56% in August, and made Tesla its top holding, representing more than 10% of the portfolio‚Äôs assets.  


Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.64% shares had already surged 15-fold in the previous two years, giving the electric-vehicle maker a market capitalization that would eventually eclipse all other car companies combined.  


Black, a former investments chief at Goldman Sachs and CEO of what is now Janus Henderson mutual funds, said in an interview Nov. 30 that he still thinks Tesla is a bargain for long-term investors.  


By traditional measures, shares of Tesla appear to be very expensive. The stock closed at $1,145 on Nov. 30, and was up 62% for 2021, following a 743% increase during 2020. Tesla trades for 136 times the consensus 2022 earnings estimate of $8.43 a share among analysts polled by FactSet. In comparison, the price-to-earnings ratio of the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index, of which Tesla is a member, is 20.8.  


The Tesla ‚Äòcontroversy‚Äô  
Black said he likes stocks with ‚Äúcontroversy.‚Äù  


In the case of Tesla, he said the debate is whether the company can maintain its electric-vehicle market share while global EV adoption grows. He expects Tesla to increase its total addressable market (TAM) because of new products, including the Cybertruck, expected in late 2022, and a new Tesla compact model expected in 2023, along with increased production in existing factories and the opening of new factories in Texas and Germany.  


All the numbers that follow are for battery electric cars, or BEVs. That means plug-in hybrids are excluded.  


Tesla sold an estimated 386,000 electric cars during the first half of 2021, according to EV-Volumes.com, which estimates sales of BEVs will total 4 million for all of 2021. If Tesla were to maintain the same pace of sales for the second half of 2021, its BEV market share for the year would be an estimated 19.3%.  


Black‚Äôs case for Tesla‚Äôs value today  
Based on his own estimates, which incorporate third-quarter numbers provided to the Future Fund team by Bloomberg, EV-Volumes.com and other industry sources, Black expects the world BEV adoption rate to climb to 6% in 2021 from 3% in 2020, and continue rising to 30% by 2025. Meanwhile, he expects Tesla to hold a 21% market share.  


Those estimates point to a 56% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for industry BEV sales, with a 55% CAGR for Tesla‚Äôs sales. Black also estimates a 59% CAGR for Tesla‚Äôs earnings per share through 2025.  


Black‚Äôs estimate for Tesla‚Äôs market share is higher than EV-Volumes‚Äô numbers for the first half of 2021 indicate because of supply constraints.  


‚ÄúYou will wait six months now if you order a new Tesla. When the new factories come online, they can gain more share,‚Äù he said.  


These Twitter postings include data backing Black‚Äôs estimates:  


Going further, Black estimates Tesla will earn $12 a share in 2022, which is well ahead of the consensus EPS estimate of $8.43. More controversy, but this underlines his investment thesis. He expects EPS to keep growing to $40 in 2025. Based on the closing price of $1,145 on Nov. 30, that would make for a P/E of 28.6 ‚Äî not very high for such a rapidly growing company.  


The expectation of continued rapid growth for Tesla explains not only Black‚Äôs enthusiasm for the stock but that of other money managers.  


Deeper long-term thesis  
Stepping back from the numbers, Black listed what he called four ‚Äúingredients‚Äù for electric vehicles: battery range, performance, technology and safety.  


While the competition is catching up on battery range, he said that for performance and technology, Tesla is still ahead of the competition. He added that Tesla has, by far, the highest number of fast-charging stations available, and that drivers of competing EVs can buy low-cost adapters to use Tesla‚Äôs stations and possibly feel envious of Tesla owners while waiting.  


For safety, he said Tesla‚Äôs track record is good, and cited General Motors Co.‚Äôs GM, +0.48% recall of Chevrolet Bolts for battery fire risk, and GM‚Äôs instructions to customers on how to limit that risk.  


Finally, Black addressed concerns that increasing competition in the EV space would hurt Tesla‚Äôs market share or make it less profitable.  


Black cited Amazon as an example, citing skeptical investors years ago who had expected traditional competitors to take back market share from Amazon as they built-out their on online sales capabilities. We all know this didn‚Äôt happen.  


One thing we can all be sure of is that the world will continue to change rapidly for all vehicle manufacturers as buying habits change and governments continue to push for a rapid transition to EVs.  


Black cited the Chinese government‚Äôs cooperation with Tesla, which opened its factory in Shanghai in 2019, as a long-term boon not only for Tesla, but for China‚Äôs entire EV market.  


‚ÄúYou throw a catfish in with all the competitors to keep them aggressive,‚Äù he said, referring to this New York Times article.  


A new catalyst for Tesla and its competitors in the U.S. market might be just around the corner. President Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù spending package, if passed by Congress, is likely to lift the 200,000-vehicle limit on $7,500 per-vehicle tax credits for EVs. Tesla and GM have exceeded that limit.  


Black expects the two new factories to double Tesla‚Äôs production capacity. Near term, the completion of Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs sale of 10% of his Tesla shares may relieve pressure on the share price. Black also expects bond-ratings agencies to raise Tesla‚Äôs credit rating to investment-grade because of its strong cash flow and relatively low level of debt.",Bullish

Especially because we probably won't see any or just a few cars out of Texas and Berlin this year, so let's don't count on it. However after hearing some new rumours out of China, this could really be a big deal. To start with thats where the infos come from: [https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1464715352630251520?s=20](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1464715352630251520?s=20)

Jason Yang has been a reliable source in the past, he also leaked the October MY run rate of 1600 cars per day, that turned out to be true. So on top of that he is now saying Shanghai is ramping up M3 production to 2000 units per day. This is MASSIVE!!! Shanghai would produce 3.600 cars per day! WOW! I also have a feeling that the ramp up from M3 is to LFP models, but let's don't further go into batteries, let's work with the numbers we have.

So 3.600 cars per day would put Shanghai at a run rate of 108.000 cars per month. So assuming they would be able to keep this rate during November &amp; December we would get additional 216.000 cars out of Shanghai. Adding the 55.554 cars sold in October we would get 271.554 cars out of China in Q4. Let's say Fremont keeps the same and produces around 112.000 cars we would be at a total of 384.554 cars for Q4. This would be a 61% increase over the already massive Q3. WOW!

Lets add the potential 384.554 from Q4 to the rest of 2021: 624.520 + 384.554 = 1.009.074 ü§Øü§Ø

This of course really depends since when Tesla achieved such a run rate in Shanghai (beginning of Nov or just recently). But still if this turns out to be true, I can't imagine what run rates Berlin and Texas will achieve. I feel more bullish then ever on this company!",Bullish

304,Why Tesla's Stock Looks Headed For All-Time Highs,2021-11-22 22:43:42,"Melanie Schaffer , Benzinga Staff Writer   

Why Tesla's Stock Looks Headed For All-Time Highs

On Monday, Tesla, Inc TSLA +1.74% (Get Free Alerts for TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter ""at least 50%"" of (his) tweets were made on a porcelain throne. MIT research scientist Rex Fridman responded to say ‚Äúso then Twitter is a game of thrones,‚Äù to which Musk replied with a laughing-out-loud emoji.

&amp;#x200B;

Fridman‚Äôs quip, a reference to the television series may also have been written to highlight Musk‚Äôs history of using the stage Twitter provides him as a game to act as a puppeteer, able to manipulate stock and crypto prices in less than 280 characters.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, Musk may have begun using cryptic tweets to allude to a Dec. 9 Tesla stock split and fintwit personalities such as u/robgrav3s and u/adamhoov have spent time sleuthing the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the theory began making its way around social media early last week, Tesla has erased most of its losses caused by Musk selling over 5.7 billion shares between Nov. 8 and Nov. 16, with Nov. 15 marking a reversal to the upside at the $978.60 level. Traders and investors may be attempting to front-run the potential stock split news because if history repeats an announcement of a second split for Tesla could take the stock on an all-time high run.

&amp;#x200B;

The Tesla Chart: Tesla reached a new all-time high of $1,243.49 on Nov. 4 and entered into a short-lived downtrend on the daily chart. The stock then printed a low at $978.60 and reversed course into an uptrend with the most recent higher printed on Monday and the most recent higher low printed on Nov. 18 at $1,078.02.

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday, Tesla partially filled an overhead gap between $1,197 and $1.208, which was a likely scenario considering gaps on charts fill about 90% of the time. There are two lower gaps with the first between $910 and $944.20 and the second between the $843.21 and $849.74 range, which are also likely to fill at some point in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

After filling the gap during the morning, Tesla retraced down toward the opening price in consolidation. Consolidation is needed because Tesla‚Äôs relative strength index registers in at about 65% and when a stock‚Äôs RSI nears or reaches the 70% level it becomes overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla inventory closed greater on Thursday, whereas different EV shares slumped.


Wedbush‚Äôs value goal is the best on Wall Road, together with the highest finish of Jefferies‚Äô outlook.

Wood said that GM and Ford are seeing stellar stock performance this year, with investors giving them some credit for their attempts to shift from internal combustion engines, or ICE, to electric vehicles but the big challenge is EV manufacturing is not inherent to those companies.

‚ÄúAnd the reason is they don‚Äôt have the DNA for this brave new world,‚Äù said Wood during an interview with MarketWatch sister publication Barron‚Äôs in a Wednesday afternoon interview.

Wood said that Ford and GM ‚Äúwere¬†born in the industrial, gas-powered age‚Äù and said that they have to make ‚Äúone giant leap,‚Äù¬†to transforms their ICE focused businesses.

## Tesla EVs To Be Studied In Australia To Check If Batteries Can Power Grid

4:43 am ET November 17, 2021 (Benzinga) 

**Tesla Inc** (NASDAQ: TSLA) car owners will be a part of a¬†study conducted by Australia's **University of Queensland** to check if its electric vehicles' spare battery capacity could support the energy grid and power homes, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

**What Happened:** The university has partnered with analytics platform Teslascope for the research project, which would recruit Tesla owners to check their driving and charging habits.¬†¬†

The first phase of study would recruit 500 Tesla owners based in Australia, the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Britain.¬†

Other automakers could be added at a later stage.

*See Also:* *Elon Musk Says Tesla Cybertruck Can Power A Tiny House*

The mission aims to find how electric vehicles can be used as ‚Äúbatteries-on-wheel‚Äù given that only a part of the electric vehicle‚Äôs full driving range is currently used by its owners.¬†

The data would be collected through the vehicle's software interface and in return users would¬†be offered a free premium subscription to Teslascope for a year.

**Why It Matters:** Tesla owners in Texas reportedly used their electric vehicles to charge their homes earlier this year when a winter storm and power outage left them stranded without electricity. Elon Musk has in the past downplayed the usage of vehicle-to-grid technology to power homes during an outage.¬†¬†

The vehicle-to-grid technology competes with Tesla‚Äôs Powerwall ‚Äî a rechargeable home battery service that stores energy from solar or from the grid and makes it available on demand.

323,TSLA Valuation based on Factories Profit.,2021-11-13 18:59:46," 

Keep it simple. It's about the machine that builds the machine. Factories.

Tesla made 1.5 Billion net profit last Q with 2 factories, while building 2 factories!

With 4 Tesla Factories(F) = (1 Billion Net per F per Q) 4 Billion Net Profit minimum per Quarter. So, that equals 16 Billion per year Net Profit just on cars! Play with this Net Profit number per F.

I see 50 percent improvement in Profit per factory once completed. **6 Billion X 4F =24B/yr Net Profit** on cars only! **So multiply 24B x future PE ratio.** Amzn has a pe ratio of over 100. If you take just **80 PE x 24 Billion =1.92 TRILLION. Or 60 PE = 1.44 Trillion.**

Now add FSD, solar, charging network, Tesla Bot and Mega pack sales.

Tesla can build a new factory with every 1.5 Billion. They made this in less than a year off Bitcoin investment.

Tesla Crashes German Party; VW Says Work Harder, BMW Plays Premium Card  
Neil Winton  
Neil WintonSenior Contributor  


Tesla TSLA -0.4% Model 3 topped the European electric car sales charts in September and beat out of sight the challenge from Germany over the first nine months, and this provoked a wary reaction from Volkswagen, conceding that Elon Musk‚Äôs company was much more efficient, while BMW cast aspersions about Tesla quality and heritage.  


Tesla sold 24,574 Model 3s in September to take the number 1 spot, way ahead of 8,199 VW ID.3s and 4,310 ID.4s, according to data from Schmidt Automotive Research.  


For the first 9 months, the Model 3 led with just under 100,000 sales compared with the 2nd placed VW ID3 at **close** to 52,000 and 44,600 little Renault Zoes. There were no BMW electric cars in either top 10 list. BMW will up its battery electric vehicle (BEV) threat in 2022 when its recently launched i4 sedan and iX SUV hit the market.  


Tesla‚Äôs threat will jump a few notches too when its German factory begins making Model Y SUVs for the German and European market.  


Volkswagen group CEO Herbert Diess, currently under pressure from the company‚Äôs union which objects to his plans to make VW more profitable, told an employee meeting last week that Tesla at its Brandenburg, Germany, factory will make 90 cars an hour for 10 hours a day. This compares with VW‚Äôs Zwickau plant which makes the ID.3 and ID.4 and takes 30 hours to make one, although he hoped to cut this to 20 hours next year, still twice as inefficient as Tesla.  


The union had been angered by reports Diess had said VW had 30,000 excess workers in Germany. Its German workforce totals 290,000.  


VW said Tuesday it will build a new factory near to its Wolfsburg HQ for its next generation BEV called Trinity, expected to launch by 2026 at the latest, and hopes to reduce the manufacturing time per car to 10 hours.  


Tesla also outsold VW‚Äôs Golf in September, which is mainly conventionally powered and is usually Europe‚Äôs biggest selling car, bar none.  


BMW CEO Oliver Zipse, who earlier this year doubted Tesla could retain its lead in BEVs as competition tightened, tried a different tack Wednesday.  


‚ÄúWhere we differ is our standard on quality and reliability. We have different aspirations on customer satisfaction. Tesla isn‚Äôt quite part of the premium segment. They are growing very strongly via price reductions. We could not do that since you have got to last the distance,‚Äù Zipse said in an interview in the business newspaper Handelsblatt, according to Automotive News Europe. The interview offered no evidence on standards or reliability.  


The Tesla factory is currently cranking up production of the Model Y which will go on sale in 2022. In the New Year, at least BMW won‚Äôt be able to play the not-made-in-Germany card.",Bullish

Tesla Inc¬†(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†is making headlines Monday after posting a poll on Twitter over the weekend in regard to selling Tesla shares.

What Happened:¬†Musk took to Twitter to ask his followers whether or not they support him selling 10% of his Tesla stock position.¬†

""I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes,"" Musk said in a follow-up tweet.¬†



The results of the poll show that about 58% of those who voted are in favor of Musk selling Tesla shares.¬†

Musk may be considering selling Tesla shares¬†because he is reportedly facing¬†a tax bill of more than $15 billion¬†on stock options.

Why It Matters:¬†""At the end of the day, it continues to be¬†a containable amount. I still view it as a blip on the radar,""¬†Wedbush¬†Securities analyst¬†Dan¬†Ives¬†said Monday on CNBC's ""The Exchange.""

356,How does TSLA compare to the big tech stocks in terms of value?,2021-11-07 18:41:18,"Two things I look for in a stock - **value** in a low [Years to Market Cap](https://www.reddit.com/user/MoonshotStonksApe/comments/qakni8/years_to_market_cap/), and **growth** in a high [Rule of 40](https://www.reddit.com/user/MoonshotStonksApe/comments/qak8rf/using_the_rule_of_40_to_assess_growth/).  ‚ÄúAll models are wrong, but some models are useful‚Äù ‚Äì I find these two models very useful to assess valuations. Although I don‚Äôt personally invest in the big tech stocks, I thought you might be interested to see how my analysis applies to these names alongside TSLA. I'm not trying to be bullish or bearish here - just present the facts as I see them.

|Ticker|Market Cap ($T)|Analysts|2021 E Revenue ($B)|2021 E Income ($B)|Price to Sales|Forward Revenue Growth|Forward Net Margin|Forward Rule of 40|Years to Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|FB|0.92|42|118|40|8|19%|31%|49%|5|
|GOOG|1.95|33|254|73|8|16%|26%|42%|6|
|AMZN|1.72|39|470|23|4|17%|6%|23%|6|
|MSFT|2.51|37|176|68|14|12%|36%|49%|7|
|AAPL|2.49|29|366|95|7|4%|25%|29%|7|
|TSLA|1.22|25|51|5|24|32%|11%|43%|9|

Based on my Years to Market Cap metric, FB and GOOG are the best ‚Äòvalue‚Äô plays right now ‚Äì out of the six biggest stocks. TSLA, AAPL and MSFT look frothy by comparison. Particularly TSLA with the recent run-up. Before said run-up, TSLA looked very comparable with the others.

While TSLA is a little hot right now, it‚Äôs certainly not astronomically expensive, as some would suggest. I think cries of overvalued fail to consider that the market is forward looking. A decent sell-off tomorrow caused by Musk‚Äôs tweet, could bring TSLA back in line with the others, and could change the picture dramatically.

The forward Rule of 40 suggests that AAPL and AMZN are going to lag the others in terms of growth, they‚Äôre looking more like mature companies to me, rather than out-and-out growth companies. Personally, I like to invest in growth companies with an R40 greater than 40%.

358,Chances of Tesla getting into chip manufacturing?,2021-11-07 10:25:24,"Both Tesla and Starlink are suffering from the global chip shortage at the moment.

There's been an established pattern where if Elon is not satisfied with external suppliers he ends up doing things internally. (See: batteries, FSD software, FSD chip, etc.)

What are the chances of Tesla setting up its own chip fab, perhaps in a JV with a chip maker?

381,Tesla Giga Shanghai Expected To Crush Q4 Deliveries,2021-11-01 18:22:39," By**:** **Ben O'Hare**

Things are going well for [Tesla](https://insideevs.com/tesla/) at the moment, with the firm‚Äôs stock soaring and a record number of cars being delivered. However, it looks like Q4 will bring even more success ‚Äì largely thanks to Giga Shanghai. The Chinese plant is reportedly producing upwards of 1,600 [Model Y](https://insideevs.com/tesla/model-y/)s per day, meanwhile some are estimating over 2,000 [Model 3](https://insideevs.com/tesla/model-3/)s are being built there each day. For reference, back in August it was reported that 1,000 Model Ys and 800 Model 3s were being built at Giga Shanghai on a daily basis.

In Q3 Giga Shanghai was responsible for 44% of Tesla‚Äôs sales, producing 133,238 vehicles. However, now a record number of cars are being spotted in its lot ‚Äì over 2,150 on October 28th according to a video posted by drone operator [Jason Yang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTrsRvDqoKw6DTJMLKCuM-Q).

Giga Shanghai is constantly increasing its production capacity. The factory first started producing cars in late 2019 at a restricted volume. However, the $2 billion plant is now in full flow with over 2,000 full-time employees.

Tesla has already delivered 627,350 cars this year ‚Äì shattering their previous record (set in 2020) of 499,550. With one quarter left to go, could we see Tesla break the 1,000,000 mark in 2021? Only time will tell.",Bullish

392,Tesla is spearheading the paradigm shift to EV - $3k in 2022,2021-10-30 13:19:18,"There‚Äôs a paradigm shift from ICE cars to electric Cars. The big US automakers, GM, Ford, Chrysler, have over 500,000 employees of which 90%+ have ICE experience and ZERO electric car experience. Their legacy can be their demise trying to compete with Tesla‚Äôs 70,000 employees of which 100% only works with/on electric cars. These employees are building and operating robotics manufacturing plants, developing, and maintaining proprietary supercomputers, AI software, semiconductors etc just like any computer manufacturer but the Tesla PC has wheels. Tesla logs millions of miles every day analyzing the worlds roads and traffic situations and feeds this information into their AI systems to perfect Full Self Driving software. Tesla is millions of miles ahead of the competition and the competition not only has to do a 180 as far as manufacturing but also the entire mindset of every employee. That‚Äôs not done overnight. GM boldly states to be even with Tesla in 2025, I‚Äôll take the under!

It‚Äôs the manufacturing stupid! Tesla uses thousands of less parts manufacturing cars with robotics which leads to less cost and higher output/time. My guess is some of the competition will fold, simply because of being to late to the party and not surviving the 5-10 years it would take them to ‚Äústart from scratch‚Äù because that‚Äôs what they must do (even if they don‚Äôt think so and believe they can use existing staff and equipment and just retool a little). 

Never mind Tesla‚Äôs cars being rated the safest, fastest and imho nicest cars on the road leading to an unlimited demand. They are smarter, being produced faster and cheaper.

Robotaxis will rely on AI software and learning the roads and traffic situations so that we can remove the steering wheel and just have a nice relaxing ride with no accidents (Tesla cars running FSD are 10 times safer that those with a manual driver).

Obviously, Tesla‚Äôs software, AI and manufacturing/robotics expertise can be used outside building just cars. 

Don‚Äôt forget powerpacks, solar roofs, Boring and SpaceX relationship that completes the future possibilities. Batteries will become cheaper and last longer and soon to be propulsion of boats and planes (unless the world accepts nuclear).

What‚Äôs Tesla worth when the competition fails while Tesla is speeding down the road with driver-less cars, 10‚Äôs of millions of them earning money for every mile.

My estimation is that it will be worth $5T by 2030 and way before then they will have discovered many new income streams from a captured audience taking a ride ‚Äì think Advertising and proprietary in-car entertainment offerings.

428,"TSLA Earnings Prediction: They beat estimates, but by how much?",2021-10-19 17:42:51,"As many of you know, [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA) is releasing their Q3 earnings report this Wednesday (October 20th) after market close, and I have a [prediction](https://utradea.com/positions/TSLA-Earnings-Prediction-Is-beating-estimates-going-to-be-enough). Over the past 12 quarters of earnings releases Tesla has traded down 80% of the time with an average loss in the next trading session of 2.7%, and the other 20% of the time, Tesla traded up after earnings, with an average increase of 0.9%. So historically they have performed relatively poor when it comes to earnings, however, I am setting out to find if this earnings report will beat the odds and launch Tesla‚Äôs stock close to their previous high of $900/share.

TSLA stock as it is up 50% over the past 5 months (averaging a monthly return of 8.4% during this timeframe). Additionally, the TSLA stock is up 7% over the past 5 trading days, which is a large return during this small timeframe. As a result of their performances over the past 5 months (and 5 days), there are currently a lot of eyes on the TSLA stock, and there is a lot of hype around their upcoming earnings report. However, since it has been hyped up over the past week it might take a large earnings beat to push the stock higher than it is trading for today.

***Q2 2021 Earnings Report:***

I think that it is very important to understand Tesla‚Äôs performance in their previous earnings report, and the reaction that ensued the next trading day. Furthermore, I think it is important to see the points that they highlighted as key contributors to their earnings, and the factors that may have hurt their earnings.

TSLA beat earnings in Q2 2021 by a wide margin, reporting an EPS of $1.45 compared to the estimated $0.98, and reporting revenues of $11.96B in comparison to their estimated revenues of $11.3B. There were also other factors in these earnings that are important, however these 2 key metrics lead to the earnings beat, which resulted in TSLA opening 0.9% higher the next trading day, and closing down 2% at the conclusion of the next trading day. This is important to note as even when TSLA has a great earnings report, they can still trad lower the following day, which will be important for investors to know come the October 21st trading day.

*Important things to note:*

**Cost of Revenue:** In their earnings report, Tesla noted a few factors that contributed to their increase in their cost of revenues. Firstly, and most obviously, they had more deliveries, which made their cost of revenue figures increase. Secondly, they noted that higher outbound freight/duties from China (Gigafactory) increased their cost of revenues. Lastly, they noted that the cost of materials, manufacturing, inbound freight helped to offset (decrease) the effects of higher Chinese freight costs.

***Q3 2021 Earnings Predictions:***

*Revenue from Regulatory Credits:*

Tesla earns their regulatory credits by the amount of EV‚Äôs they sell. These credits are also weighed based on the range of the vehicles that they sell. Based off of my calculations, (which can be found at the bottom of this article) I believe that Tesla will make $424.5M off of the sale of regulatory credits.

*Automotive Revenues:*

On October 2nd, 2021, Tesla released their production and delivery figures for Q3. I can use these figures to estimate their automotive revenues for Q3 2021. Based off of these figures and the average price per car, I estimate that Tesla‚Äôs revenues will be $11.71B for Q3 2021.

*Automotive Leasing Revenues:*

By my calculations, using the past 2 quarterly earnings reports, in conjunction with their quarterly vehicle deliveries, I found that based off of the Q3 deliveries, Tesla‚Äôs leasing revenues should be $356M.

*Energy generation and Storage Revenues:*

I did not have much to base this off of, so I held it constant. I did this because if I am wrong, I should be understating these revenues, which is a more conservative estimate.

*Services/Other Revenues:*

Based off of their historical growth in this sector, I projected these revenues to be $1.01B.

**Total Revenues:**

I think that Tesla‚Äôs total revenues for Q3 2021 will be $14.3B, which would represent earnings beat. This is due to the fact that the average analyst estimate for their revenues is at $13.5B. If my prediction comes true, Tesla will beat their revenue estimates by nearly 6%. This represents very similar earnings beat percentage as achieve in their Q2 earnings report.

**Cost of Revenues:**

I think that the automotive cost of revenues will increase by 20%. This is due to the fact that aluminums prices are up by 27% since Q2 earnings, steel prices are up 15% since last earnings (price to manufacture cars up 20%), and that freight prices haven‚Äôt changed QoQ. Additionally, Tesla manufactured 20% more cars since last earnings (additional 20% cost of revenue due to higher volume). This would bring the automotive cost of sales to $8.54B.

Furthermore, I took all of the other cost of revenue items and calculated them based off of historical % of revenues (respectively). By doing this I concluded that all other costs of revenue would total $2.02B. Which would conclude the total cost of revenues for Q3 to be $10.56B

**Gross Profit:**

Based off of my calculations, Tesla‚Äôs gross profits should be $3.747B

**Net Income Attributable to Shareholders:**

Based off of historical percentages of net income to net income attributable to shareholders, I can conclude that Net Income Available to Shareholders for Q3 2021 should be $1.48B

**EPS:**

Since there are 990M shares outstanding, Tesla‚Äôs EPS should be $1.50 which would represent Tesla meeting their Q3 earnings estimates.

***Overall Thoughts:***

Based off of my calculations, Tesla should narrowly beat their earnings. This should be good for the stock; however, we have seen what has happened to Tesla in previous earnings beats.

I think that Tesla will open the following trading day up between 0.5-1% and fall to even or even -0.5% by the close.",flair not available

435,Top 10 Trending Stocks on Reddit - TSLA at #6,2021-10-03 15:17:09,"Hey Everyone,

Wanted to provide an update for the top trending tickers on Reddit last week. It is interesting seeing if sentiment is a leading or lagging indicator, as well as the correlation to price. The dashboard is a work in progress but so far it has been useful for me to track trending stocks and be able to see new tickers on the leaderboard - before they become too popular.

**Dashboard and Trending Stocks**

Before we jump in, I wanted to provide a bit of background. This is a work in progress so I want to be transparent with how we are tracking these trends. If you have any thoughts on how I can make this more useful please let me know.

**Tracking Mechanics**

* The algorithm pulls data from multiple subreddits using the reddit API. The subreddits it is pulling from are non-stock specific subreddits (i.e. WBS, investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc.)
* It then plots mentions with price over a give timeframe (Right now you can look at 72hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month)
* We also display sentiment, number of posts, comments, and upvotes. Sentiment is determined using Spacy and a text classification dictionary

**Why did we build this?**

* We wanted a way to track social sentiment across a number of social media platforms. Studies show that sentiment can impact the price of a stock and we wanted to see if there is a way to leverage this and provide it to individual investors. The more you know, the better.
* Allows you to see the overall trends, and the quickly drill into the posts to validate the content.

**Future plans**

* **Twitter (Beta)** \- currently testing a way to capture twitter sentiment. I think there is opportunity to follow and track what a number of the largest Fintwit accounts discus and corelate to the price movement of smaller cap stocks. This is my hypothesis but I need to test it.
* **Social Trend Score -** ultimately we want to be able to identify trending ticker before the price takes off, or before it drops - we are planning on incorporating data from multiple social platform

**Top 10 Trending Stocks on Reddit**

The screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending tickers in the last 72hrs.

**Other Thoughts**

The other tickers you see are ones that are usually on the leaderboard (AMC, GME, TSLA, QQQ, etc.) which is why it is useful to see what tickers are up and coming on the trend list. This leads me to another thought, it might be useful to be able to filter out certain tickers.

**TLDR**; Track trending tickers on Reddit and potentially catch a ticker before the price hits a peak. The view also provides a way to quickly drill into potentially new tickers or stocks, and find the associated DD.

438,After a long run I sold half my TSLA holdings today,2021-10-01 19:46:14,"      After months of weighing options I decided this was the best move for my family.

      I've been in TSLA since 2013 when I decided to invest as a single mother,  and never sold even when times were hard. TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!
 
        I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     
       So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.

      Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.

        Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I've decided to just not let myself think on those terms.
     
 
       I now feel a security in knowing that if it rises, I still have half my holdings and will enjoy watching my position climb again.  And if it goes down, I will have the option to buy the dip.

       I was surprised at how stubborn my pride was when deciding whether to reduce position or not!   This ride has been wild over the years.

      I'm happy to still be on it! But happy I was able to exercise making a tough decision that I knew was the wisest, for me",flair not available

495,Things are not going well for Tesla in the Netherlands,2021-06-25 18:09:55," Things are not going well for Tesla in the Netherlands. The complaints about the service and quality persist. After the summer, some three hundred Tesla drivers want to bring a billion-dollar claim against Elon Musk's company. Meanwhile, sales in the Netherlands have collapsed. This mainly concerns the Model X and Model S, of which more than 20,000 have been sold in the Netherlands. That's a claim size of ‚Ç¨557 million. Across Europe, that could be ‚Ç¨3.6 billion.  

The car that spontaneously brakes when it shouldn't or doesn't brake when it should: cost per car ‚Ç¨8,500. Creaking noise at thresholds, LED lights of ‚Ç¨1000 each that break down after two years and premature replacement of the front suspension for ‚Ç¨4200. These are just some of the 17 complaints Tesla drivers frequently experience when getting into their expensive electric cars.

Tesla was very popular in the Netherlands in previous years due to tax rules.  For a long time, it was even the number one selling car.  This year, the supply of EVs from other brands has made it a lot less popular.  These kinds of reports in the Dutch newspapers do not help Tesla.",flair not available

**Can Tesla be Touched?**

Love them or hate them, there is no denying the fact that Tesla has revolutionized the automotive industry. With new EV manufacturers coming out by the dozen, and legacy automakers changing their whole business model/plan to incorporate EV‚Äôs many have tried to emulate the success of Tesla; however, none have succeeded. Today I will break down [$TSLA ‚Äì Tesla Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA) and provide my thoughts on them, so that you get a good understanding of their business as a whole. Without further ado here is my analysis.

**Company Overview:**

Tesla designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and leases Electric Vehicles (EV‚Äôs), energy generation/storage systems, and other sustainable energy products. Tesla sells their products directly to their customers through their website and retail locations across the globe.

Tesla is focused on expanding their infrastructure through expanding their vehicle services centers, Mobile service technicians, body shops, super-charging stations, and destination chargers so that they can accelerate the adoption of their products/vehicles.

Tesla‚Äôs main goal is to lower the cost-of-ownership of their vehicles, which can be done through increasing the efficiency of their manufacturing process through innovative processes, offering financial services/options to their customers that fit their needs, and by increasing production.

Tesla‚Äôs mission is to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy, by reducing their costs and innovating their technologies.

Tesla operates in two main reportable segments, which will be broken down in the ‚ÄúInvestment Information‚Äù section of this report.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

*1.* *Automotive Segment:*

This segment includes the automotive design, development, manufacturing, sales/leasing, and automotive regulatory credits portion of Tesla‚Äôs business. This segment also includes used vehicle sales, merchandise, and other aspects that are not directly related with producing their vehicles.

This segment includes Tesla‚Äôs Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. Furthermore, it will include other models in the future like the Tesla Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, and the new Tesla Roadster.

¬∑ **Model 3:** The Model 3 is a 4-door sedan that has been manufactured and sold by Tesla since 2017. The Model 3 has a base price of $45,000 (CAD), and is the cheapest model manufactured for mass-market appeal.

¬∑ **Model Y:** Tesla‚Äôs Model Y is their SUV that seats up to 7 people. The Model Y has been manufactured and sold by Tesla for a year now and starts at $55,000 (CAD) and still has a mass-market appeal.

¬∑ **Model S:** Tesla‚Äôs Model S is their 4-door Sedan that they have manufactured and sold for 9 years. The Model S is marketed as more of a luxury vehicle and has a base price of $113,600 (CAD). The Model S is one of Tesla‚Äôs best-performing, and longest-range vehicles they offer.

¬∑ **Model X:** Tesla‚Äôs Model X is their 7-seater SUV that has been manufactured and sold by Tesla since 2015. The Model X offers high-performance and long ranges and is also marketed as their ‚Äúluxury‚Äù offering. The Model X starts at $123,600 (CAD).

¬∑ **Cybertruck:** Tesla is yet to start selling their ‚ÄúCybertruck‚Äù models. The Cybertruck was created to capture the market for Electric Trucks and cater to truck owners more so than Tesla‚Äôs other models would. The Cybertuck has a base price of approximately $50,000 (CAD)

¬∑ **Semi:** There has not been a lot of information released about this project just yet, however they are expected to start at $150,000 USD

¬∑ **Roadster:** Once again, there is not a lot of public information about this vehicle, however their production is estimated to start in 2023. What we do know is that it will be fast.

This segment of Tesla‚Äôs business brought in revenues of roughly $29.54B in 2020, which is a 28.16% increase YoY. However, the cost of revenue in this segment was $22.93B, which is an increase of 19.61%. Since the revenue growth is larger than the cost of sales growth their margins should be increasing for this segment, which in 2020 they did, moving from 21% (2019) to 26% (2020).

*2.* *Energy Generation/Storage:*

This segment includes the design, manufacturing, installation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation/storage systems under the ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù brand. This segment also includes related products and services of these solar energy systems.

Some of the biggest products in this segment include Tesla‚Äôs Powerwall, Powerpack and their Megapack. All of these ‚Äúpacks‚Äù are lithium-ion energy storage systems that come with inversion and control technology.

This segment of their business brought in approximately $2B in revenue in 2020, which is an increase of over 30%. However, the cost of sales for this segment in 2020 was 1.98B, which increase by 47.76%, which is not good as the increase in cost of sales should not be this much higher than the revenue growth. In 2020, Tesla barely made a profit on their Energy Generation/Storage Segment of their business. Their margins on this segment decreased from 12% in 2019, to 1% in 2020.

*Battery and Powertrain:*

Tesla has designed their own, proprietary, Powertrain systems that are adaptable, efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. Tesla offers dual-motor powertrain vehicles that maximize traction and performance in their AWD configuration. Additionally, Tesla is constantly looking for ways to improve upon their technology and are planning to introduce their tri-motor powertrain for even better performance.

Tesla vigorously tests their technologies, and products by undergoing extensive R&amp;D processes that are meant to improve their battery cells, packs, and systems to deliver the best performance and drive. Tesla is currently developing a new, proprietary lithium-ion battery cell to maximize their productive efficiencies.

*Self-Driving:*

Tesla uses both vision and radar-based sensors to power their autonomous driving features. Furthermore, Tesla is developing additional hardware to efficiently use the field data their cars collect to improve their networks for improved self-driving performance.

Tesla is looking to further improve their [Full Self-Driving (FSD)](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/support/full-self-driving-computer) technologies so that eventually no human driving assistance is required. This should theoretically improve the safety, and efficiency of driving, and change the way we transport.

*Macroeconomic Trends:*

Throughout the pandemic there were many different supply chain issues, and surges in demand that left products at a shortage. Early on in the pandemic, there were toilet paper, mask, and hand sanitizer shortages, later on in the pandemic, there were housing shortages, and lumber shortages. One of the biggest shortages that came from the pandemic and is currently ongoing is the semiconductor and chip shortages.

These shortages have caused ripples in the automotive industry, with many producers both newcomers and legacy automakers having to halt production. As you can imagine, this has had adverse effects on the stock price of these companies making the shortage even more painful for these companies.

However, there was one company who saw this coming and adapted the quickest in order to avoid many of the supply chain issues that plagued other automakers. This company was in fact, Tesla.

This can be observed through a snippet of a shareholder letter, in which they said, ‚ÄúIn Q1 we were able to navigate through global chip supply shortage issues in part by pivoting extremely quickly to new microcontrollers, while simultaneously developing firmware for new chips made by new suppliers.‚Äù Furthermore, Tesla was said to have stocked up on chips before time, which also helped them to maintain high levels of production amidst the shortage.

It was this quick thinking and decision making that helped Tesla to adapt and overcome this obstacle, while many other companies just took it on the chin. Tesla‚Äôs actions/decisions to avoid this shortage is likely to have saved them millions, if not billions of dollars in revenue that would have been foregone.

[Elon Musk Says the Auto Chip Shortage Is Like the Toilet Paper Frenzy (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-chip-shortage-is-like-toilet-paper-frenzy-2021-6)

*Regulatory Credits:*

In 2020, Tesla brought in revenues of $1.6B selling regulatory credits to other automakers who exceeded their emission caps. This is all well and good except for the fact that in 2020, Tesla‚Äôs net income was $721M. This means that if regulatory credits were non-existent Tesla would have a net loss in 2020 of $879M. However, we know that regulatory credits exist, and that they are lucrative for EV makers like Tesla, so what is the problem?

In 2021, the competition in the EV space is heating up, as newcomers are starting to release their vehicles (ie $CCIV- Lucid Motors), and there are many different legacy car manufacturers that are starting to design, develop, and produce EV‚Äôs of their own (ie $GM ‚Äì General Motors, $F ‚Äì Ford etc.). This is bad for Tesla for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, legacy automakers will be reducing their own emissions and will have a decreased demand to buy regulatory credits from other automakers, as they will be able to meet emission standards or be closer to meeting them than before. This should have adverse effects on Tesla, as they currently sell their regulatory credits to other automakers, and if these companies no longer need as many credits as possible, then Tesla will not be able to sell their credits and lose revenues on that portion of their business.

Secondly, there are many newcomers to the space, which is also bad for Tesla and their credit selling. This is because these new companies will also be receiving these credits and selling them to other automakers. This increased supply of regulatory credits is likely to devalue existing credits, which may have severe effects on Tesla‚Äôs profitability.

Regulatory Credits are an important factor in Tesla‚Äôs business models, and any decline in their regulatory credit sales could have severe effects on the future profitability of Tesla. This is something to keep in mind as an investor, especially if their regulatory credit sales start to slow down.

However, if Tesla can shift its reliance away from regulatory credit and find a way to be profitable through their regular operations, then this worry goes away for many investors, and they may enter positions. I think that Tesla can rely on regulatory credits for the next couple of years as the demand for these credits is not likely to subside in the near term. However, in this time they need to find ways to improve their profitability so they can be self-sustaining moving forward. This is a large speedbump for Tesla, however if they are able to navigate it properly, they will be rewarded.

In their [Q1 2021 investor deck](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22), Tesla reported a net income (in Q1) of $464M, and they also reported $518M in income from regulatory credits. This means Tesla would have only lost $54M without the support of their regulatory credits. Although this is still ‚Äúbad‚Äù it is better than their Q4 2020 results, as they would have lost $105M without the assistance of regulatory credits. This shows that Tesla is moving away from their dependence on these credits rather quickly which is a good sign for investors, and something to keep an eye on.

*Financial Information:*

¬∑ **Financial Performance (Good):** Tesla‚Äôs revenues were up 28.32% YoY, their gross profits increased by 62.90%, they reported their first ever income from operations, and their total assets increased by 52% YoY. Furthermore, their R&amp;D costs increased by roughly 5% YoY, which is good to see in a business-like Tesla, who needs to keep innovating in order to survive.

¬∑ **Financial Performance (Bad):** Tesla‚Äôs accounts payable almost doubled YoY, their automotive service revenue is down 3.57% YoY, stock-based compensation expenses were up by 93.10% which usually would be alright however this number is very high. Lastly, their regulatory credit revenue of almost $1.6B helped to prop up Tesla‚Äôs revenue, however, as more companies convert to electric this revenue source is likely to deteriorate.

¬∑ **Stock Based Awards:**  As of 2020, Tesla had 66,000,000 shares locked up in their stock-based awards. If these shares were to be put on the market today it would have a dilutionary effect of 7.07% on the already existing shares.

¬∑ **Warrants:** As of December 2020, Tesla has 47M shares that can be converted from warrants. If these warrants were to be converted to ordinary shares and sold, this would dilute the pre-existing shares by roughly 5.04%.

¬∑ **Convertible Senior Notes:** Lastly, there are 37M ordinary shares that can be converted from senior notes. If these notes were to be converted today, there would be a total dilutionary effect of 3.97%.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to find Tesla‚Äôs WACC on a website called [Finbox](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA/models/wacc), which shows how they arrived at their WACC. This site estimated Tesla‚Äôs WACC to be 8%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR:*

I used Tesla‚Äôs 2020 EBIT growth rate as my CAGR, which is mainly due to the nature of my DCF model. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 20.66% which is somewhat conservative given some of the other CAGR estimates floating around.

*Interest Expense Decrease Rate:*

To find this figure I took the average decrease rate of Tesla‚Äôs interest expense (found on Yahoo) over the past 2 years. By doing this I arrived at an average annual interest expense decrease rate of 0.51% which I used in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I found Tesla‚Äôs effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2020 to be 25% through their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-004599/)

*Competition Information:*

In order to get the best results out of my comparable analysis, I had to choose the best companies that emulate the business model and operations of Tesla. Ultimately, I decided to choose the following 4 companies based on the above criteria, these companies are $NIO ‚Äì Nio Inc., $XPEV - Xpeng, $GM - General Motors, and $LI - Li Auto.

Nio, Xpeng, and Li auto are all Chinese EV manufacturers that are do not threaten Tesla‚Äôs operations, however they have similar technology and are at similar stages to their business. Furthermore, these companies (like Tesla) focus solely on manufacturing electric vehicles which makes their operations mimic that of Tesla‚Äôs to a certain extent.

Additionally, I have decided to incorporate General Motors as a competitor for a few reasons. Firstly, General Motor‚Äôs is located in the USA and has committed to a large investment in order to start manufacturing competitive EV‚Äôs. Furthermore, GM has pledged to release 30 different EV‚Äôs by 2025 and are committing to an all-electric future. GM poses a bigger threat Domestically and Internationally to Tesla than the other Chinese EV companies (at least currently) and GM is a legacy vehicle maker with the capability to produce large amounts of EV‚Äôs.

**Investment Valuation:**

There were two ways in which I was able to value Tesla in order to see if it is currently undervalued, overvalued, or properly valued. These methods include a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model, and a Comparable Analysis.

*DCF:*

My DCF model discounts Tesla‚Äôs projected Free Cash Flows (FCF‚Äôs) over the next 10 years. I was able to conduct this analysis through various pieces of information which can be found above in the ‚Äúvaluation information‚Äù section. By undergoing this DCF model I arrived at a fair value of Tesla of $25.94, which implies a downside risk of 95.73%. As you can probably tell, this projection is very low, and their stock is very unlikely to hit this price. However, this DCF shows the extent to which Tesla is overvalued, and why many investors are cautious when looking to invest in Tesla.

Typically, DCF models are not used to value high-growth companies like Tesla, and often there is not enough data or good enough financials in these high growth companies in order to even conduct a DCF model. For this reason, I am not focusing on the results of the DCF too much, however it is good to know this information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

In order to do a well-rounded comparable analysis, I decided to compare Tesla‚Äôs [EV/Assets](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/ev-to-assets/), [EV/Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-revenue-multiple.asp), and [P/B](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/using-price-to-book-ratio-evaluate-companies/) to their main competitors as listed in the ‚ÄúCompetition Information‚Äù section of this report. Since all of the comparable companies are high-growth Electric Vehicle companies, the comparable ratio‚Äôs/multiple‚Äôs that I chose were the only 3 that I could choose given the negative ratio‚Äôs/multiples of Tesla and in some cases their competitors.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Tesla‚Äôs EV/Assets multiple against their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of Tesla of $149.81, which would imply a downside risk of 75.35%. This is a large downside, so I decided to compare the other ratios to see if tis result was consistent among them.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Tesla‚Äôs EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that tesla has a fair value of $248.45, which would imply a downside of 59.12%. This downside is not as severe as the implied downside through the EV/Assets comparable, however it is in agreeance with that comparable based on the fact that Tesla is overvalued. Additionally, I decided to undergo one last comparison to further validate/invalidate this idea.

*P/B:*

By comparing Tesla‚Äôs P/B ratio to that of their competitor‚Äôs I arrived at a fair value of $331.15, which would imply a potential downside of 45.51%. Once again, this downside less than that achieved by the other comparable analyses, however they all agree on the fact that Tesla is overvalued. To get one final comparable price estimate I decided to take the average of my 3 comparable results.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of each comparable, I arrived at one all-encompassing valuation of Tesla of $243.14, which would imply a share price decrease of 59.99%. This is implying a large decrease in the share price, which most likely will not happen, however knowing Tesla is this overvalued is concerning. There are some problems with my comparable that I will discuss next.

*Potential Problems:*

In my comparable analyses, I was comparing Tesla to Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto, and General Motors, and there are some problems that came from doing this.

Firstly, Nio, Xpeng, and Li Auto are all Chinese securities. This could be considered a problem given the nature of Chinese stocks being severely undervalued. Historically, Chinese stocks have been heavily discounted in comparison to many American stocks because of the diplomatic and political uncertainties in China, and as a result people are willing to pay less for these stocks. This is a problem because their low financial ratios and multiples that come with being undervalued are exaggerating how overvalued Tesla really is.

Next, there is some problems that arise with choosing GM as a comparable company. Firstly, GM is a legacy automaker that has historically manufactured cars that run solely on fossil fuels. As a result of this, they have already made significant revenues and are at a different stage in their business than Tesla is. This helps to make GM‚Äôs ratios lower than any EV manufacturer can be at given the current state of EV companies. This makes Tesla look ridiculously overvalued, when in fact it is just comparing apples to oranges in a sense.

**Risks:**

¬∑ **Dilution:** Currently, through warrants, stock awards, and convertible notes, there is a maximum share price dilution of 16.08% that is possible. However, this dilution is likely to be spread across the next 5-10 years, which minimizes the immediate effect of it. This dilution may seem high, however for high-growth companies like Tesla this level of dilution is quite standard and is lower than most.

¬∑ **Regulatory Credits:** Currently, Tesla depends on the income generated through their regulatory credits in order to have a positive net income and there are some concerns with this. There is a lot of uncertainty that lies in these credits, as the rules around them can be changed, however if Tesla finds a way to phase out their dependence on these credits or generate a net income without their help than these worries will for the most part subside.

¬∑ **Macroeconomic Conditions:** As I mentioned before Tesla was able to forecast the chip and semiconductor shortages which worked out well for them. However, there is bound to be other macro factors that are going to be thrown at Tesla, and if they are not prepared for them, they could face adverse effects.

¬∑ **Expectations:** Tesla has a lot of large expectations from their investors for the future, however Tesla has previously failed to deliver on some of these expectations and will likely fail to meet some expectations in the future as well. A good example of how this is a risk and effects their share price was through [their recent cancellation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/elon-musk-says-tesla-officially-canceled-the-model-s-plaid-plus.html) of their Model S ‚ÄúPlaid‚Äù, after this news broke Tesla fell 0.25%, which may not seem like a lot, however the EV sector as a whole was up around 1%. This example was a smaller deadline on one product release, however there are larger expectations that will have catastrophic effects if not met.

¬∑ **Elon Musk:** Elon Musk has been the backbone of Tesla for a long time and has a very important role in the company. However, in the past his sporadic tweets have had negative effects on Tesla‚Äôs share price, a famous example of this Is when he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184?lang=en) ‚ÄúTesla stock too high IMO‚Äù after which their share price dropped 10%. Recently, his tweets have been influencing the crypto markets, however if he starts to tweet about Tesla things could get ugly. Furthermore, if Musk steps down from Tesla (like Bezos did with Amazon) their stock could take a hit.

**Catalysts:**

¬∑ **Green Act:** I did not talk about this during the article because I do not believe this has been confirmed yet. However, the [proposed Green Act](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/global-equities-research-10-catalysts-for-tesla) has been estimated to grant Federal tax credits of up to $7,000 for the next 400,000 Tesla vehicles sold. This will help sway the decisions of people who are on the fence about buying a Tesla and should help Tesla to drive sales.

¬∑ **Expanding into New Countries/Geographies:** Recently, Tesla has exported their vehicles to Japan, Hong Kong, Poland, and Turkey, which is great. If Tesla continues to expand their presence Internationally and announce that they are expanding their operations into new countries, investors will be excited, and their share price should pop.

¬∑ **New Vehicle/Factory Announcements:** If Tesla announces that they are going to build another factory, or they announce that they have started production on a new model (ie. Cybertruck) then this announcement could help to rally the shareholders and help the stock.

¬∑ **Financial Performance:** If Tesla can continue to grow and become more profitable in the future, this will be great for the company, and if they are able to exceed the already high expectations, then their share price will benefit greatly. One thing in particular to watch out for is when they can become profitable without the assistance of regulatory credits as it will send a message to the doubters about Tesla‚Äôs ability to make their own profits.

A breakout in either direction for Tesla is very likely to occur within the next 4-5 weeks.  The charting is perfectly set up for it, and the consolidation we've seen (at least by Tesla standards) this year is likely to end.  


With that in mind, I noticed Tesla options currently are at their cheapest levels in the last 52 weeks (shown in video).  This could present an amazing time to buy options on this, in either direction.  I have a big bullish position (relative to my portfolio) on this for March 2022 as a vertical spread, but have short positions for the summer somewhat as a hedge to that and the stock I own in Tesla.  I strongly recommend keeping a close eye on options pricing for this in the coming weeks.

For those driving without Autopilot but with the Tesla's active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 2.05 million miles driven. As for those driving without Autopilot or active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 978,000 miles driven.¬†

My problem is when TSLA goes into ""beast-mode"" when I have no position yet.  I have a day-trader account and sometimes use active-trader market orders (auto-send without confirmation).  I see MACD and RSI turning up ... one green candle with volume, two green candles with volume, my heart is racing ... [it looks like TSLA just went into ""beast-mode""], third green candle with volume forming ... I hit the buy market order button without confirmation ... I'm in with a sizable position, but I got in at the mid-point of the third green candle with volume ... the fourth or fifth candle shows up *initially* as red or green that turns to red ... it could turn back to green, but it could remain red ... if it remains red, it could be downwards in an amount equal to two or more the preceding green candles.  [I knew that $750 was a resistance level, but I also knew the recent high had been $780-ish ....]  This is essentially what happened mid-day on Friday (04/16/2021), give or take a candle.  By the time I realize it is a full on red candle with volume and I see my profits dwindle in a matter of split seconds (literally -- this is happening in less than 1 second), I hit the market sell button .... Oh dear ... I've only made $112 bucks and the stock jumped 10+ dollars in share price ...  I missed the first 2.5 green candles because I waited for confirmation TSLA was in ""beast-mode"" ... I lost profits on the red candle because I was hoping it would turn green or that the next candle would be green ....

Should I only do this on all green candles with volume and just exit at the first sign of a red candle, which may or may not turn to green?  Is there a better way to play a ""beast-mode"" break-out when I have no current position?",flair not available

There are over 19,000 open PUTS for 5/21 at the $1,050 and $1,100 strikes.  

To put this in perspective there are only a cumulative 38 open contracts at those strikes for April.  

What's more the highest concentration of CALL strikes moves up to $850.

My theory is that the sellers of these high strike PUTS are going to be applying significant upward pressure on the price to prevent losses.  They won't encounter much resistance until they meet the sellers of the $850 CALL strikes.

648,ICE future is bleaker in the strategic sense than projected by media who wants us to think that ICE incumbents will make smooth transition to EV,2021-04-03 11:41:45,"&amp;#x200B;

Total ICE capacity worldwide is more than the current ICE market which is shrinking, it has several unintended consequences

* ICE incumbents will be fighting for the larger share of the shrinking market, so it all came to the price and margins will reduce further
* If all existing investment is treated as sunk cost the variable and marginal cost of building every new ICE is the magic number and as ICE sales decrease there will be some increase in variable cost as it's implicitly connected with the total number produced
* Common areas of cost setting will increase R&amp;D, workforce, manufacturing shutdowns, and retooling for #EV whatever it can be, reduction in dealership, in short profits on ICE will be killed long before ICE is actually killed
* ICE production capacity and manufacturing will have significant write-offs as the capacity is likely to be redundant and uneconomical before depreciation is accounted for and the impairment will be needed, which is not priced in yet
* Since ICE incumbents are at different stages of #EV adoption and production, also varies in terms of R&amp;D, product, and service offering also market share is to be conceded to EVs so, we likely to see a decline in ICE studies and labor force similar to O&amp;G (2014-present)
* Though unpopular, the best bet for ICE companies is to sell the capacity and brands before it becomes liabilities and bite the bullet now, get cash and invest in EV mobility. Someone who is far behind in race likely to take an existential crisis will become clear
* As EV expected to grow exponentially and as it eats the market for ICE, beyond a point, it doesn't matter what you want to buy EV will be the better value proposition both in price and availability. The opportunity in ICE will be 2nd hand market and maintenance
* I hear ICE c-suite discussing with confidence about their transition plan. Just remember these guys have got every step wrong in EV transition barring few exceptions and currently lack the best tech and ecosystem. It's lip service than actual commitments",flair not available

653,Here's what my algorithm said about long-term TSLA investments,2021-04-01 21:56:26,"**Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)**

**Today's market cap:** 635.18B

**Current price:** $661.75

**Website:** [http://www.tesla.com](http://www.tesla.com)

Tesla, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally. The company operates in two segments, Automotive, and Energy Generation and Storage. The Automotive segment offers electric vehicles, as well as sells automotive regulatory credits.

**Company size:** Considering 498.62B in market cap in the last 200 days, TSLA is a mega-sized business = it should be much more resilient against market volatility, but **only if the other markers also suggest that**.

**Dillution:** The latest split happened on 31, Aug 2020 with a split rate of 5:1.

**Stability:** With a Beta of 2.06013, TSLA very often fails to go along with the stock market = Extreme volatility and unpredictability.

**Short interest:** A short interest of 5.80% means that some stockholders are wagering against the TSLA stock = Fair backer confidence. You shouldn't think about a **short squeeze**. *(a short-term jump in the value of the stock).*

**Dividend:** That stock doesn't pay dividends. This might (but doesn't have to) imply that Tesla, Inc. still wants to develop or might lack confidence.

**Price growth:** The average price of TSLA has grown by 42.00% in the last 50 days compared to the past 200 days (That's a lot!) = Such percentage generally shows that TSLA is still promising in the nearest future. Bear in mind that such big shifts might be temporary! The smaller the business, the higher the danger 

*Compare the most recent average prices yourself! 200 days: $519.48; 50 days: $737.68; 20 days: $654.05.*

**Volume growth:** Investors have recently become absolutely disinterested in buying and selling the TSLA equities as the average volume over the last 50 days went down by as much as -36.77% in comparison to the last 200 days = This indicator may lower the intensity of the others - for better or worse. 

*Compare the most recent average volumes yourself! 200 days: $53.52M; 50 days: $33.84M; 20 days: $41.82M.*

The bitcoin rally is ""very long in the tooth"" and could be about to sharply reverse course, according to one currency strategist. Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, told CNBC this week CME Group's announcement that it will introduce micro bitcoin futures could be a sign that the market is at the top. ""Last time they announced that there was going to be futures"" ‚Äì which was in 2017 ‚Äì ""bitcoin actually hit \[the\] top,"" Schlossberg said.

Tesla announced in March that it had started accepting bitcoin as payment , while PayPal said on Tuesday that its US customers can use their cryptocurrency holdings to pay at millions of its online merchants globally. ""I don't think any asset that has a volatility of 20% per week can really act as a currency at this point,"" Schlossberg said.

Since I assume TSLA won't announce deliveries until after the 4/1/2021 close, this leaves a decision over whether to take the hefty option profit now, hold it to see if Q1 deliveries send us back to $700/share.

So, I've got 40% of my money in Tesla, 40% in the Nasdaq ETF QQQ, and then 20% on the ASIA ETF and in MQG (an ASX stock). 
BUT
I'm very deeply considering selling my QQQ and loading up on Tesla during this dip. I'm super bullish on Tesla (and the Nasdaq), but in my mind, Tesla's growth will always outperform the market and give better returns. 

However, it goes against all the rules of diversification and is much riskier! Nasdaq is an absolute sure bet that it'll make that golden average of 10% per year, Tesla isn't as reliable, but there's the huge possibility that it'll average about 16% per year instead, or higher.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time $TSLA dipped more than 30% was March 2020 from $190.  The bounce (which was an amazing buying opportunity), actually occurred at 62% from it's high @ $70 PPS.

&amp;#x200B;

$TSLA is currently down 30% from its high of $900 but went as low as 39%.

&amp;#x200B;

So, once again, I'm looking for the 62% correction at $350 PPS by mid MAY 2021.  May is significant because that is the expected deadline for GIGA Austin to be completed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\-------If $TSLA corrects from this $550 PPS level, I will start purchasing on the way back up around 23% down from $900 PPS which would be $685 PPS.

Tesla is down to no 5 in sales with 3,966 units.  This compares to VW at 11,116 - the VW group (VW, Audi, Skoda, SEAT) at 16,874 - thats 4 times Tesla's sales vol.  Most of this comes from the ID.3 - the ID.4 is only just on the market and its sales were 686.

In March the article suggests Tesla's sales will increase as their deliveries are weighted towards March.  In 2020 Q1 tesla sold 20,500 cars in Europe - so it will need to sell 16,000 cars in March just to keep still! 

The question is how will the ID.4 do against the Tesla 3 in march?  If the ID.4 outperforms the Tesla 3 when it is available this provides an indication of what will happen in the US and China marketplace when it becomes available in these markets.  US is expected to start in March for spring sales.  VW has two JV's in China which are going to produce its ID models using its new electric platform.",flair not available

Stimulus is coming, and Elon will not let 2020 Q4 happen again this year. I think buy this dip if you havent and we will be over 1k, on route to 2k by EOY. 

I could be wrong and maybe EV will have another 10 percent downtrend weak. If that does happen buy up a load of tesla. Its 3-5k a share in ten years it they're hitting say half of their targets they have planned. I will be holding for the ten at least so buy up now, if it does fly up this week hold on tight and try accumulate more. I think anywhere in the 550-700 price range is a great buy right now, still would be down nearly 30 percent off off ATH at 700.",flair not available

831,Tesla Us Market,2021-03-04 17:19:26,"This is an interesting article.  [https://electrek.co/2021/03/03/tesla-losing-market-shares-ford-mustang-mach-e-morgan-stanley/](https://electrek.co/2021/03/03/tesla-losing-market-shares-ford-mustang-mach-e-morgan-stanley/).  It positive in the sense that it suggests that Tesla's sales have risen 5% this february compared to last year, although the market has grown 40%.  Market share has fallen significantly. Competition from Ford Mustang EV seems to have taken the balance - which is interesting because the ford Mustang has suffered delivery problems and is only just being delivered - so what happens in the US market when the Ford Mustang is up to full production levels?  (Not to mention the other 150 ev models coming into the market).  

So actually its pretty grim when you consider that Tesla's share price is predicated on Tesla growing at 50% per year to reach a level of 20 million cars per year - and yet so far this year in its main market, the US, it is only selling 5% more cars, despite price cuts and overall so far this years its sales are probably down compared to last year.  Tesla's  sales in Europe, the largest global EV market have actually gone down in a high growth market because of the competition.

Tesla isn't just offering EVs... it is on pace to beat everyone else to market with Full Self Driving (FSD), and nobody else is even CLOSE to achieving their level of success with it. Literally anybody who can afford a Tesla over some other EV without self driving will choose the Tesla. This is worldwide. Everyone recognizes the brand and generally associates it with style and wealth. Tesla has also done amazing work on making sure their vehicles can travel for longer distances than competitors. (FSD will also be offered as a subscription, which opens an enormous pipeline for revenue alongside their other softwares)

Entire countries are competing to host Tesla's manufacturing. By the end of this bidding war, Tesla may have a staggeringly higher amount of plants up and running and will be manufacturing cars for a considerably lower cost.

On top of this, home energy storage is the future. This is not a question. With the resources, brand recognition, and technological capabilities that Tesla has, it is the company that undoubtedly most likely to deliver this technology to the world. That's a game changer and opens the door to the elimination of many power plants to be replaced by local and in-home clean energy generation. (Even our in-home gyms can generate power as long as we all have the capacity to store it.) Tesla also has branded itself a battery company at times and that's what puts their value off the charts.

WILD CARD FACTOR: Elon Musk has publicly announced that Tesla will begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) for payment. This means that he has the potential to set the price in terms of BTC, inflating the value to a reasonable value he chooses while simultaneously inflating Tesla's current holdings of BTC. I don't believe this is explicitly forbidden by federal regulation, and Musk wields an otherworldly power here. Tesla EVs are priced on the same order of magnitude as a single BTC and they're becoming ubiquitous worldwide, meaning they could serve as a reliable and tangible connection to the value of BTC.

Catherine Wood is on the money with this one and I think that holding a piece of Tesla is the only way to ensure you have a stake in the future of our global society. Please discuss this. I'm happy to respond.",flair not available

This is a Morgan Stanley article pointing out that Ford Mustang EV is eating into Tesla's market share in the US market and asks the question why the European car manufacturers have fallen flat on their faces.  Actually given that deliveries of the Ford Mustang have only just begun its looking pretty positive for Ford and looks like the Ford Mustang EV will be production constrained 

The answer to the European car manufacturers is that they are focussing on the European market, which is larger than the US market ,and the European models they compete with Tesla are just being introduced.  US customers tend to like larger cars.  The VW Id.3 is a bit small for the US market - but the VW ID.4 is an SUV and is coming to US in March - I think it will do well.  There are a significant number of other ev models amongst the 150 new EV's being introduced in 2021 which will compete with Tesla also in the US market.  Its lining up to be a tough fight - but good for the consumer.  Best strategy is to sell Tesla share now while they are still valued at an unrealistic level and put the money aside for a few months to buy the EV of your choice (which will come with all the gimmicky software for free).  Tesla are continuing to reduce prices to sell their cars - this can only continue given the level of competition.",flair not available

Let‚Äôs talk about the ideal mentality of an investor. It is not for nothing that Warren Buffett among many other respected investors keep stating that the market is made for the patient, and will keep stinging those who are impatient.

You have two choices. Panic sell like the inexperienced, or stay right where you are like a proffesional. In fact, many big investors are loading up on shares at a cheaper price right now.

Who are you?

There‚Äôs also the fact that crypto flicks it‚Äôs nose at FINRA‚Äôs PDT minimum requirement for day trading. It‚Äôs a good play seeing as how many people were added to the ranks of the HODL community buying dips for an entire year! 

Stonks are irrational. And after robinhood colluding with hedge funds, I see a good many people leaving the market for crypto. But here‚Äôs the thing, why is crypto good?

Still haven‚Äôt had that answered. 

Bitcoin burns energy and time to produce no underlying asset of any real physical worth. What‚Äôs going to happen to it‚Äôs value when the computing speed to mine it becomes overwhelmingly lopsided in the favor of tech? 

People will leave crypto... because it‚Äôs simply irrational to think that the concept of wealth will not intrinsically be tied to the difficulty at which it was to achieve it. 

Hypothetical example of what I mean:
You open an app on your phone, you press a button that runs a hash verification for Bitcoin mining and completes the task after several seconds. How much money did you just make? 
Obviously not as much as the people that spend weeks upon weeks burning energy running key combinations.

Even though I can‚Äôt help but respect him for his track record, I feel as though he‚Äôs full of sh*t and doesn‚Äôt understand the future potential of disruptive innovation in general and that technology, as a whole, is beyond his depth.
